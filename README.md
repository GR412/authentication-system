## About

This was the basis for a simple application that can register and authenticate users to a simple app. However I've abandoned this now as I've learnt more about how to properly structure a web application and have started from scratch with [this project](https://github.com/SneakyShrike/achievement-forum-api)
 
However I will keep this project here for me to refer back to in the future.
